Should I now just put everything into scheme.lean?

I know that O_X is a sheaf of types. I want to check it's a sheaf of rings.
To do this I just need to give O_X(U) a ring structure and check the
morphisms are ring morphisms. The latter should be easy. The former -- how
is O_X(U) defined? It's defined using

extend_off_basis (zariski.structure_presheaf_of_types_on_basis_of_standard R)
  (zariski.sheaf_of_types_on_basis R)

-- i.e. we checked it was a sheaf on the basis and then used extend_off_basis
which is in tag009N. This construction uses presheaf_on_basis_stalk FB x
which is defined in tag009H.

So the lemmas I need are

1) if I have a presheaf of rings on a basis then
presheaf_on_basis_stalk (associated presheaf of types on basis) x is a ring

-- this is kind of tag 007G -- or is it?

2) extend_off_basis (sheaf of rings on basis) is a sheaf of rings

-- this is 009Q

OLDER STUFF

Current goal: 01HR; this is the last tag in some
sense. 

Things I need:

Lemma: D(f) intersect D(g) = D(fg) is also standard open.

Lemma : D(f) form a basis of opens.

Proof: STP that every open U is a union of D(f)'s. STP that if P is in U
then there's an f such that P in D(f) in U. Say U=D(T) is primes not
containing T.  Then T is not a subset of P. Choose f in T not in P.
Then P is in D(f) and f is in T so D(f) is a sub of D(T).

Lemma (tag 00E4) : R a ring and g in R. Then Spec(R_g) -> Spec(R) is an injection
with image D(g).

Proof: Map R->R_g induces a map Spec(R_g)->Spec(R) by lemma of Kenny.

10.3 basic notions

(54) if R is a ring and S is a multiplicative subset of R then S−1R is the zero ring if and only if S contains 0,

(55) if R is a ring and if the multiplicative subset S consists completely of nonzerodivisors, then R→S−1R is injective,

(62) if R is a ring, I and ideal of R and S a multiplicative subset of R, then S−1I is an ideal of S−1R, and we have S−1R/S−1I=S⎯⎯⎯−1(R/I), where S⎯⎯⎯ is the image of S in R/I,

Definition of sheaf on basis from Reid Barton:

@kbuzzard Another option is, on D(f), form the ring by inverting all elements h with D(h) containing D(f). Now the ring only depends (up to equality, not isomorphism) on D(f), and you can subsequently show (using Zorn) that R[1/f] -> this ring is an isomorphism.
This is sort of a low-tech version of your second option, I think.
