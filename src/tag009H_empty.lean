/- section 6.30. Bases and sheaves

(summarised by KB) 

Let X be a topological space and let B be a basis for the topology.
This section explains the completely useless notion of a presheaf
of sets (say) on B; useless because there is no natural way to
extend it to a presheaf on all of X (by which I mean all the opens
in X).

It then explains the much more useful notion of a sheaf of sets on B,
which is the obvious thing: a presheaf satisfying a version of the
sheaf axiom which makes sense.

The key result is then Lemma 6.30.6 (tag 009N) which says
that given a sheaf of sets on B, there's a unique sheaf
of sets on all of X extending B. Indeed there's an equivalence
of categories between sheaves on B and sheaves on X.

The section then goes on to explain how this all works for presheaves
of stuff like abelian groups / rings, and also sheaves of O_X-modules
