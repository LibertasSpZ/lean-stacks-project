Lemma 10.16.4. Suppose that φ:R→R′ is a ring homomorphism. The induced map
Spec(φ):Spec(R′)⟶Spec(R),𝔭′⟼φ−1(𝔭′)
is continuous for the Zariski topologies. In fact, for any element f∈R we have Spec(φ)−1(D(f))=D(φ(f)).

Proof. It is tag 00BV that 𝔭:=φ−1(𝔭′) is indeed a prime ideal of R. The last assertion of the lemma follows directly from the definitions, and implies the first.
