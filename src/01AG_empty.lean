Lemma 17.3.1. Let (X,X) be a ringed space. The category Mod(X) is an abelian category. Moreover a complex
→→
is exact at  if and only if for all x∈X the complex
x→x→x
is exact at x.

Proof. By Homology, Definition 12.5.1 we have to show that image and coimage agree. By Sheaves, Lemma 6.16.1 it is enough to show that image and coimage have the same stalk at every x∈X. By the constructions of kernels and cokernels above these stalks are the coimage and image in the categories of X,x-modules. Thus we get the result from the fact that the category of modules over a ring is abelian.
