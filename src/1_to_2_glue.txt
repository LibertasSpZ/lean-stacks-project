009L input is:

  (∀ U : set X, ∀ BU : B U,
  ∀ γ : Type*, fintype γ → -- note fintype here
  ∀ Ui : γ → set X,
  ∀ BUi :  ∀ i : γ, B (Ui i),
  ∀ Hcover: (⋃ (i : γ), (Ui i)) = U,
  sheaf_property HB FPTB Hstandard U BU γ Ui BUi Hcover)


-- In practice,

-- U = Spec(R)
-- BU is true by definition
-- gamma is a fintype
-- Ui and BUi are a map gamma -> R
-- Hcover is equivalence to "the ideal generated (or spanned)
--   by the image of gamma is the whole ring"
-- sheaf_property blah is the assertion that the sequence
-- 0 -> R -> prod_{i in gamma} R[1/f_i] -> prod_{i,j}... is exact
