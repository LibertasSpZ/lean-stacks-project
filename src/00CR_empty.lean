Lemma 10.9.9. Let R be a ring. Let S⊂R be a multiplicative subset. Let M be an R-module. Then
S−1M=colimf∈SMf
where the preorder on S is given by f≥f′⇔f=f′f″ for some f″∈R in which case the map Mf′→Mf is given by m/(f′)e↦m(f″)e/fe.

Proof. Omitted. Hint: Use the universal property of Lemma 10.9.7 (tag 07K0)
